# Black Jack OOP

## Description

This is a simple Black Jack game implemented in Java. The game is played between players and a dealer. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The game is played as follows:

1.  The dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.

2.  Each player is given a turn to decide whether to "hit" or "stand". If the player hits, they are given another card. If the player stands, they do not receive another card.

3.  The player can continue to hit as many times as they want until they stand or bust (go over 21).

4.  Once all players have completed their turn, the dealer reveals the hidden card.

5.  The dealer must hit if their total is less than 17 and must stand if their total is 17 or higher.

6.  If the dealer busts, all non-busted players win.

7.  If the dealer does not bust:

    - The player wins if they have a higher total than the dealer.

    - The player loses if they have a lower total than the dealer.

    - The player ties if they have the same total as the dealer.
